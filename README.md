# Test Smell Prioritization

This repository contains the artifact for the paper:  
**"Prioritizing Test Smells: An Empirical Evaluation of Quality Metrics and Developer Perceptions" (ICSME 2025, NIER Track)**  

The artifact provides Python scripts, datasets, and documentation to **detect and prioritize test smells** using Change Proneness (CP) and Fault Proneness (FP) metrics.  
It enables reproduction of all **tables, figures, and prioritization results** presented in the paper.

## Usage

### Step 1: Clone the Repository

Clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/<your-username>/Test-Smell-Research.git
cd Test-Smell-Research
```

### Step 2: Running Python Scripts

Run the Python scripts to extract test smells and analyze CP and FP metrics. For example, to run the **FaultProneness.py** script:

```bash
python FaultProneness.py
```

Feel free to replace the script name with the one that fits your needs.

### Step 3: Running Shell Scripts

For Unix-like environments, you can run the shell scripts as follows:

```bash
bash extract_contributors.sh
```

These shell scripts are typically used for extracting specific metrics or performing analysis on the dataset.

### Step 4: Analyzing Data

The results are typically stored in CSV or other formats. You can use Python (e.g., with pandas) or other tools to analyze the output. For example, the **SmellsSummary.py** script aggregates the results for an overview of test smells and their impact on CP/FP metrics.

## Reproducing Results

To reproduce the results from this repository, follow these steps:

1. Clone the repository and install the necessary dependencies.
2. Execute the Python scripts for extracting test smells and analyzing CP/FP metrics.
3. Aggregate the results using the provided aggregation scripts (e.g., `SmellsSummary.py` or `SmellsPlusCPaggregated.py`).
4. Review the output files for a summary of the test smells and their associated CP/FP scores.
